## Purpose

Internet Gateway attachment module.

This module is part of the **AWS IaC Enterprise Library** reusable module set. It is designed as a clean, reusable and readable starting point for infrastructure teams.

## Design principles

- Secure defaults where practical.
- Consistent `name` and `tags` interface.
- Small module surface area.
- Easy review by engineering reviewers and maintainers.
- No company-specific code, credentials or private architecture.

## Example

```hcl
module "internet_gateway" {
  source = "../../modules/internet_gateway"
  name   = "example-internet-gateway"
  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "platform"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```
